<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed an exam proctoring application from scratch, moving it to an MVP state and implementing multiple feature requests. The initial work involved setting up the environment, installing dependencies for both React frontend and FastAPI backend, and ensuring services were running. Key features implemented include real-time proctoring with detection for phone, multiple faces, looking away, and no-person. Browser event monitoring (copy/paste, tab switching), microphone access, and audio violation detection were integrated. A comprehensive admin dashboard was developed with real-time updates, violation timelines, student statistics, and an evidence gallery displaying snapshots. Export functionalities for violations in CSV and PDF formats, including student-specific reports, were added. The engineer also diligently addressed numerous bugs, including UI text visibility issues, login/registration failed to fetch errors, backend syntax errors, MongoDB  serialization, and Supabase image storage challenges (which led to a fallback to MongoDB base64 storage). The work was iterative, with persistent debugging and feature refinement based on continuous user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop an AI-powered exam proctoring application.
**Initial Setup:** Get the existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application running, install dependencies, and configure it to use Supabase (initially for image storage).
**Proctoring Enhancements:**
*   Implement real-time detection for specific violations: phone detection, multiple face detection, looking away, and no-person detected.
*   Incorporate confidence thresholds for better detection.
*   Detect browser-based violations: copy/paste and tab switching, using JavaScript events.
*   Add microphone access to the student verification process.
*   Implement audio/noise detection as a violation type.
*   Capture snapshots as evidence for camera-based violations (phone, looking away, no person) with timestamp/date.
**Admin Dashboard:**
*   Visualize violations over time using a line chart.
*   Display average student statistics.
*   Ensure real-time updates for active exam sessions and violation alerts.
*   Replace Active Exam Sessions with a Students with Violations section, showing relevant information.
*   Create a dedicated Evidence Gallery section to display violation snapshots.
*   Provide instant download functionality for images in the evidence gallery.
**Reporting & Export:**
*   Enable export of all violations in CSV and PDF formats.
*   Allow export of individual student violations in CSV and PDF, including violation details. Initially included images, then simplified to text-only based on user feedback.
**UI/UX & Fixes:**
*   Resolve text visibility issues on the Admin Dashboard and the main landing page.
*   Fix Failed to fetch errors on student login/registration and admin login pages.
*   Configure admin login to use only a password () while still interacting with the backend API.
*   Remove hardcoded password hints from the Admin Login page.
*   Ensure robust image storage (Supabase vinay bucket, with a fallback to MongoDB base64 storage).
*   Address backend serialization issues (e.g., MongoDB ).
*   Remove student thumbnail images from the Students with Violations section in the Admin Dashboard for a cleaner view.

<code_architecture>

- ****:
    - Summary of importance: Core FastAPI application, handling all API endpoints for proctoring, administration, authentication, and data export, as well as WebSocket communication.
    - Summary of changes: Significantly expanded with new endpoints for browser violations, admin statistics, student-specific exports (CSV/PDF), and backend connectivity checks. Fixed critical  and other syntax issues. Re-implemented missing admin login function. Updated snapshot upload logic to be conditional based on violation type and fixed MongoDB  serialization.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: Contains the real-time video analysis logic for detecting proctoring violations (face, head pose, objects).
    - Summary of changes: Enhanced  for improved detection, including no-person and confidence thresholds. Adjusted audio noise detection sensitivity.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: Defines Pydantic data models for students, sessions, violations, and other application entities.
    - Summary of changes: Added new violation types (e.g., ) and models to support statistical data.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: Manages interaction with Supabase for object storage, primarily for violation snapshots.
    - Summary of changes: New file creation. Implemented  with robust error handling and debugging. Configured to use the vinay bucket. Implemented a fallback to store images as base64 in MongoDB when Supabase upload fails.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: Responsible for generating violation reports in CSV and PDF formats for students and administrators.
    - Summary of changes: New file creation. Implemented functions for exporting all and individual student violations to CSV and PDF. Involved multiple syntax fixes for HTML generation. Functionality to include images in PDF was added, then later removed as per user request to simplify.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: The central monitoring interface for administrators, displaying real-time proctoring data, student violations, and analytics.
    - Summary of changes: Major redesign including real-time auto-refresh, integration of  for violation timelines, and display of average statistics. The Active Sessions section was replaced with Students with Violations. Export buttons were added, and an Evidence Gallery was created with image download functionality. Also received numerous text visibility fixes and a backend connectivity check.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: The page where students undertake exams, featuring real-time proctoring monitoring.
    - Summary of changes: Integrated browser event listeners for copy/paste and tab switching. Added audio monitoring capabilities. Updated violation display logic to accommodate  and  types.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: Login interface for administrators.
    - Summary of changes: Fixed Failed to fetch errors. Migrated from a client-side hardcoded password check to using the backend API. Adapted to a password-only login field while ensuring backend communication. Corrected environment variable access from  to . Removed default password hint text.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: The public-facing landing page for the application.
    - Summary of changes: Addressed text visibility issues, particularly in the hero section and feature cards, through targeted Tailwind CSS class modifications.
- ****:
    - Summary of importance: A centralized client-side service for all API calls to the backend, ensuring consistent data handling.
    - Summary of changes: Expanded to include new API methods for browser violations, admin statistics, student data, student-specific exports, and admin login. Updated data types to reflect new backend models.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of refining the Students with Violations section within the Admin Dashboard. The explicit request from the user was to remove the small student thumbnail images displayed next to each student's name in this section, making it text-only for a cleaner appearance. The AI engineer acknowledged this task and stated the intention to proceed with this modification in . This change aims to simplify the visual presentation of students who have incurred violations, aligning with a more minimalist display as requested by the user.
